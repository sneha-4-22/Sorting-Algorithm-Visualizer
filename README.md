# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

https://sneha-4-22.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/

A web-based sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in JavaScript.

## Introduction

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to interactively see how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a visual representation of the sorting process, helping users understand and compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable speed to control the visualization tempo.
- Randomized input generation for testing algorithms.
- Step-by-step explanation of the sorting process.

## Demo

Include a link or GIF demonstrating the visualizer in action.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sneha-4-22/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
    cd Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
    ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**

3. **Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.**

4. **Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed.**

5. **Click the "Visualize" button to see the sorting algorithm in action.**

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Count Sort 
Feel free to contribute and add more sorting algorithms!
